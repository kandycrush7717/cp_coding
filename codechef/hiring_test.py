    * Question :(https://www.codechef.com/LP1TO203/problems/HIRETEST)
        A company conducted a coding test to hire candidates. N candidates appeared for the test, and each of them
        faced M problems. Each problem was either unsolved by a candidate (denoted by 'U'), solved partially (denoted
        by 'P'), or solved completely (denoted by 'F').
        To pass the test, each candidate needs to either solve X or more problems completely, or solve (Xâˆ’1) problems
        completely, and Y or more problems partially.
        Given the above specifications as input, print a line containing N integers. The ith integer should be 1 if the
        ith candidate has passed the test, else it should be 00.
    * Example :
        Input :
            3
            4 5
            3 2
            FUFFP
            PFPFU
            UPFFU
            PPPFP
            3 4
            1 3
            PUPP
            UUUU
            UFUU
            1 3
            2 2
            PPP
        Output :
            1100
            101
            0
