    * Question :(https://www.codechef.com/LP1TO201/problems/NFS)
        Chef is playing Need For Speed. Currently, his car is running on a straight road with a velocity U metres
        per second and approaching a 90âˆ˜ turn which is S metres away from him. To successfully cross the turn,
        velocity of the car when entering the turn must not exceed V metres per second.
        The brakes of Chef's car allow him to slow down with a deceleration (negative acceleration) not exceeding A
        metres per squared second. Tell him whether he can cross the turn successfully. The velocity v when entering
        the turn can be determined from Newton's 2nd law to be v^2 = U^2 + 2*a*S if the car is moving with a uniform
        acceleration a.
    * Example :
        Input :
            3
            1 1 1 1
            2 1 1 1
            2 2 1 1
        Output :
            Yes
            No
            Yes
